    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large zucchini, ends trimmed</li>
        <li>½ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>½ (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cook and stir the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until the meat is browned,
                 breaking the beef up into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Drain off excess fat, 
                 and transfer the beef into a mixing bowl. Slice the zucchini in half the long way, and 
                 use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2-inch thick shell all around the zucchini.
                  Chop the scooped-out zucchini flesh, and add to mixing bowl. Stir in the bread crumbs, 
                  garlic, spaghetti sauce, black olives, and Parmesan cheese; mix the stuffing well. 
                  Lightly stuff both halves of the zucchini with the meat mixture. Place the zucchini 
                  halves into a baking dish, and cover tightly with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, remove from oven, and remove the foil. 
                Sprinkle 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over each zucchini half. Move an oven rack
                 to within 6 inches of the oven broiler's heat source, turn on the broiler, and broil 
                 the zucchini until the mozzarella cheese is browned and bubbling, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
